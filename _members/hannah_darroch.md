I am from Auckland and completed both my undergraduate and postgraduate studies at the University of Auckland. Nearly 10 years ago I was introduced to zebrafish as a research model and have been lucky enough to spend time in both the Auckland and Dunedin based zebrafish facilities. During my PhD at Auckland I used zebrafish to interrogate changes in innate immune cell function following inflammatory stimulation. Here I learned the ins and outs of zebrafish genetic manipulation, as well as many other useful techniques including microscopy and microinjection. I am now 2 years into my first postdoc in the Leask lab at the University of Otago. My current research themes are focused on understanding the genetic contribution to metabolic disease including areas of personal interest such as how inflammation or innate immune cell behaviour may impact metabolism (again using zebrafish as a model). When not staring at zebrafish, I enjoy staring at my hands while it takes me two years to knit something and playing with my orange cat whose favourite toy is a shopping bag.
