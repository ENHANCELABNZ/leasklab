I’m a BSc (Hons) student in physiology in the ENHANCE lab in 2025. My project is “investigating genetic predisposition to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in zebrafish”, where I will be creating the letrozole induce zebrafish model of PCOS and assisting Olu with creating the candidate gene knock-out zebrafish. As a physiology student, learning about how the understanding of genetics can enhance understanding of the pathophysiology of complex diseases such as PCOS have been very interesting. Outside of University, I enjoy playing water polo, spending time with my friends and family and going to the beach with my dogs back home in Christchurch.
