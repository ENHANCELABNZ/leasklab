I lead the Equity iN Health And Non-Coding Elements (ENHANCE) lab. The ENHANCE lab research projects aim to assign function to genetic variants that are associated with health and disease using bioinformatics, zebrafish and cell assays. We work with Māori and Pacific genetic data to identify clinically-relevant genetic variants that are unique to Māori and Pacific people and we focus on conditions that affect women and are underrepresented in the research space. The long-term outcomes of our work has the potential to reduce health disparities and improve genetic equity in these underrepresented groups.
