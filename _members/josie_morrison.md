I am a Genetics Honours student, and my project is "Understanding the regulatory potential of transposable elements in the placenta." I am passionate about rare diseases, human genetics, and how genetic risk factors — including epigenetic mechanisms like non-coding RNA — contribute to complex conditions. In my spare time I love to read, go op shopping and hang out with friends.
