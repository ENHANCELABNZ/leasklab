I'm a PhD student interested in pancreatic islets in type 2 diabetes mellitus. My project has two parts, 1) Investigating the effect of hyperuricaemia on pancreatic beta-cell mass and 2) Investigating non-coding RNA as potential biomarkers to track islet cell mass. To achieve this, I am utilizing cell culture and zebrafish models, as well as some human samples from the HeartOtago study. I'm learning how to use zebrafish and bioinformatics to answer these questions. In my spare time I enjoy cooking, cycling, and taking photos of myself in hats.
