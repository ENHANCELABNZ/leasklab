  description: The ENHANCE lab is dedicated to understanding the genetic factors that influence health outcomes for Māori and Pasifika peoples. Many diseases, such as gout, are prevalent in these populations and have well-established underlying genetic components. Previous research has identified Māori- and Pacific-specific genetic variants linked to disease risk, and we aim to expand this knowledge by identifying new population-specific genetic variants and conducting functional analyses to uncover their biological effects.

  Genomic databases largely exclude Māori and Pasifika peoples, threatening to widen health inequities as precision medicine advances. By addressing this gap, our research will not only enhance the genomic representation of these populations in health-related studies but also uncover novel disease mechanisms relevant to all populations. Our findings could improve diagnostics, enable early interventions, and lead to more inclusive and effective treatments for all. Here in Aotearoa, we have a unique opportunity to explore how inherited genetic variation in these populations contributes to disease risk, ensuring Māori and Pasifika communities benefit equally from future medical innovations.

  As a Māori-led lab, we are also committed to strengthening Māori and Pacific genomics by recruiting and mentoring Māori and Pasifika students in this critical field while fostering strong relationships with the communities we serve.

  By elevating Māori and Pacific genomics into global research, we aim to create to a future where precision medicine is equitable and effective for all.

  decription: Non-coding elements are far more than just “junk” DNA. Genome-wide association studies indicate that >90% of variants associated with complex disease lie within the non-coding genome. Despite their significance in disease, there has been limited research on these elements. In contrast to the protein coding genome, where a variant will have more obvious functional consequences, these elements are a lot more complex and it is harder to decipher their effect on genes. 
  
  These elements, such as enhancers, promoters, and silencers, are key regulators of gene expression. Promoters are involved in the initiation of transcription. Enhancers bind transcription factors that help drive gene expression whereas silencers act to repress it. Variants in these non-coding elements can greatly alter transcription which may contribute to distinct phenotypes. A classic example of this variation is when there is a change in the _HERC2_ enhancer sequence that causes decreased expression of the _OCA2_ gene, leading to an individual having blue eyes. 
  
  Our lab investigates the contribution of the non-coding genome to metabolic conditions such as gout, diabetes, and polycystic ovary syndrome. These are all prevalent chronic conditions in which the aetiology is not well understood. Using zebrafish as a model organism, significant non-coding variants associated with these conditions can be investigated to understand their impact on gene expression.

  description: We utilize DanioVision (Noldus) analytic technology to gain insights into larval zebrafish behavioral patterns. The high-throughput capabilities of zebrafish enable large-scale experiments of up to ninety-six larval zebrafish under one experimental condition. Through multiple-day readouts of cumulative movement and initiation of startle responses via dark flashes and auditory stimuli, we are able to expand our understanding of how our manipulation of the genome impacts behavior by direct comparisons between homozygous and  heterozygous gene-knockout populations versus a standard wild-type control. Use of DanioVision technology hopes to elucidate abnormalities in circadian rhythm activity in functional gene-knockout populations through assessment under multiple experimental light conditions: constant light, standard light/dark cycles, and inverse dark/light cycles. Leveraging behavioral analyses is a key method we use to draw conclusions on how upstream noncoding regulatory regions impact downstream effectors _in_ _vivo_.

  We use MAPmap, a **m**itogen-**a**ctivated **p**rotein (MAP) kinase-based whole-brain immunostaining technique to gain insights into brain region-specific structural and activity profiles. The staining of total ERK (tERK, the MAP kinase) is used with morphometry algorithms to register image data to a reference atlas; the amount of consistent shrinkage/expansion across fish in certain areas can indicate region-specific neurodevelopmental problems or lesions associated with disease. The phosphorylated form (pERK) is an indirect readout for recent bursts of increased neural activity. The ratio between pERK/tERK can then be used to gauge changes in the coordination of brain excitability across regions, fish, and experimental groups, providing insights into how our manipulations impact brain function. All this information can be referred back to the zbrain reference atlas, where comprehensive gene and protein -specific whole-brain staining information is available and parcellated into defined neuroanatomical designations. By using this resource, we are able to contextualise and formulate new hypotheses based on gene/protein expression and colocolisation patterns to further our understanding of brain function.
