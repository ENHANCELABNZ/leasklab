Brain mapping

We use MAPmap, a *m*itogen-*a*ctivated *p*rotein (MAP) kinase-based whole-brain immunostaining technique to gain insights into brain region-specific structural and activity profiles. 
The staining of total ERK (tERK, the MAP kinase) is used with morphometry algorithms to register image data to a reference atlas; the amount of consistent shrinkage/expansion across fish 
in certain areas can indicate region-specific neurodevelopmental problems or lesions associated with disease. The phosphorylated form (pERK) is an indirect readout for recent bursts of increased neural activity. 
The ratio between pERK/tERK can then be used to gauge changes in the coordination of brain excitability across regions, fish, and experimental groups, providing insights into how our manipulations impact brain function. 
All this information can be referred back to the zbrain reference atlas, where comprehensive gene and protein -specific whole-brain staining information is available and parcellated into defined neuroanatomical designations. 
By using this resource, we are able to contextualise and formulate new hypotheses based on gene/protein expression and colocolisation patterns to further our understanding of brain function.
